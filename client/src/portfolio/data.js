    Hi, I'm Chappy Asel ðŸ‘‹
    <br/><br/>
    I'm a self-driven full stack developer eager to try new things and continue
    to expand on my areas of knowledge. I recently graduated from the
    University of Washington with a degree in computer science and a minor in
    entrepreneurship. In September 2021 I joined the TDG Software team at
    [Apple](https://www.apple.com) as a full-time AR/VR software engineer and
    am based in Mountain View, California.
    <br/><br/>
    In the past, I have had the privilege of interning for a variety of
    companies, including
    [Apple](https://www.apple.com),
    [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/),
    [Lime](https://www.li.me),
    [Xevo](https://www.xevo.com),
    [Suplari](https://www.suplari.com),
    among many others. While working at each of these companies, I have gained
    valuable insights into how both established companies and startups scale and
    function as well as how effective leaders and cutting-edge products are
    forged from positive, electric work environments.
    <br/><br/>
    Beyond developing products that solving real-world problems to improve
    people's lives, I enjoy challenging myself physically via weightlifting,
    organized endurance events, and hiking. I also enjoy spending time with my
    family and friends whenever I can find the time.
    <br/><br/>
    Below is a list of some of my recent personal projects. I have published two
    of these projects,
    [Homework App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1097438761)
    and
    [Weightlifting App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1266077653),
    to the iOS App Store which have a combined 360k+ installs. Homework App
    was acquired in early 2019 by a private investor with which I negotiated
    the terms personally.
